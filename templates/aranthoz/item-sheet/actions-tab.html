    <h2>Item Actions</h2>
    <p>In the Actions-section of your actionable item, such as Skills, Weapons and Consumables, you can define one rollable action, which will automatically roll 1d100, checking it against a specific threshhold value, and apply additional effects such as calculating health and mana.</p>
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>For Skills you'll have to define a roll threshhold value similar to the attribute values of your character-attributes, which will determine whether your item-roll is sucessfull by checking this value against 1d100. For Skills, you'll also have to define the ressource costs upon a successfull or unsucessfull throw, which will then be automatically substracted from your characters ressource pool.</p>
    <h3>Weapons</h3>
    <p>As you can't use a weapon without a suitable character attribute - a sword for example can only be used efficiently by a character that has learned a "Swordfighting"-attribtue of some sorts. Reflecting this limitation, you'll have to define an attribute-link instead of a roll threshhold value. By selecting an attribute from your characters attributes, the attribute-link creates a connection between your weapon and your selected actionable attribute. The attribute value of your linked attribute will now serve as your roll threshhold value upon using your weapon by rolling 1d100, determining if the use of your weapon was successfull</p>
    <h3>Consumables</h3>
    <p>Consumables can be used without any restrictions besides the amount of consumables you have in your possession. Naturally, if the amount of held consumables is less than 1 for any given consumable, you won't be able to use said consumable. Similarly to Skills reducing your characters ressource-pool, using a consumable will automatically reduce the amount of hold consumables of this type in your inventory by 1.</p>
